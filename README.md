# Credit Score Classification Using Machine Learning Techniques

This repository contains the final version of my Credit Score Classification project. The goal was to develop a predictive model to classify credit scores using various machine learning techniques, aiming to enhance credit scoring accuracy and minimize forecasting errors.

## Dataset

The dataset utilized for this project includes detailed information on customer demographics, financial behavior, and historical credit data. The data was preprocessed and analyzed to extract meaningful features essential for accurate credit score classification.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Contains a Jupyter Notebook with code for data cleaning, handling missing values, and feature engineering.
- **Modeling:** Includes a Jupyter Notebook with code for building, training, and evaluating machine learning models for credit score classification.
- **Output Files:** Final output files include prediction results and model performance metrics.

## Tech Stack

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Jupyter Notebook

## Setup Instructions

To reproduce the results of this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
